<center><h2><b>Land Conversion</b></h2></center>
<p>Land conversion is a change in part or all of the function of land from its original function
 to another function and affects the environment and the potential of the land itself.
 Land conversion occurs because humans need more land to meet their needs, along with the development of the era and population.</p>
 <h3><b>Examples of Land Conversion</b></h3>
 <p>forest
 land conversion is one of the examples. It include changing forests into agricultural land, plantations
 (such as oil palm), mineral mining areas, road construction, and also settlements.</p>

 <br><p>The next example of land conversion is agricultural land that is converted into industrial land. For example, the steel
 industry, electricity, sugar, gas, petroleum, building materials, automotive, and also textiles.</p>

 <br><p>The other example of land conversion is the construction of roads and infrastructure. Roads, especially toll roads, cross kilometers of land.
 In the process of building roads and infrastructure, various types of land are converted.</p>

 <h3><b>Solution</b></h3>
 <p>To control land conversion. The Indonesian government has created control strategies such as:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Reducing the chances of conversion</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Developing progressive land taxes</li>
        <li>Increasing the efficiency of land needs for non-agriculture so that there is no abandoned land</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Controlling land conversion activities</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Determining permanent food areas</li>
        <li>Limiting the area of land that can be converted in each district/city which refers to the ability to procure independent food</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Land conversion control instruments</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Making laws and regulations</li>
        <li>Allocating deconcentration funds to encourage local governments to control the conversion of agricultural land, especially rice fields</li>
    </ul>

<center><h2><b>Plastic Problems</b></h2></center>
 <p>The problem of waste has become a big issue in Indonesia. The problem of waste, especially plastic in Indonesia, is a serious matter that affects the environment, public health, and ecosystem sustainability.</p>
 <p>Environmental activists consider that the use of single-use packaging, including gallons, is counterproductive to the spirit of reducing plastic waste globally and nationally. Surprisingly, the promotion of the use of packaging is actually even more massive.</p>
 <img src="https://thumb.viva.co.id/media/frontend/thumbs3/2018/12/06/5c08a044d5f48-sorot-sampah-plastik_665_374.jpg" width="250" height="153"></img>
 <p>Data from the National Waste Management Information System of the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (SIPSN KLHK) in 2022 recorded that the number of national waste piles reached 21.1 million tons. Of the total, 13.9 million tons or 65.71 percent can be managed, while the remaining 7.2 million tons or 34.29 percent have not been properly managed.  In other data, it was found that there were 69 million tons of waste produced by the people of Indonesia throughout 2022. In detail, 18.2 percent or 12.5 million tons is plastic waste. Not a few of the millions of tons of plastic waste just end up in the sea.</p>
 <p>The amount of plastic waste every year also continues to increase. One of the contributors to the increase in the amount of plastic waste is the behavior of Indonesia people who often use single-use plastics. The use of single-use packaging, including gallons, has indeed become a big problem that must be solved immediately.</p>
 <p>Urban Greenpeace Indonesia campaigner, Muharram Atha Rasyadi emphasized that single-use gallons will clearly become a new problem. He said the use of single-use gallons is also not in line with the government's target of reducing waste in the sea by 70 percent by 2025.</p>
 <p>The Indonesia Consumer Institute Foundation (YLKI) also regrets the existence of single-use gallons because it adds to environmental problems. Moreover, single-use plastic packaging is very burdensome on the earth because it is difficult to decompose.
"Why is this even producing new single-use plastic materials. We do not support such packaging products," said the YLKI Sularsi Board.</p>
<p>The problem of single-use gallons requires serious attention to realize sustainable solutions. With increased consumer awareness, government support and industry innovation should be able to walk in a greener direction and reduce the negative impact of single-use gallons on the earth.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of companies engaged in PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) recycling in Indonesia:
<ol>
 <li>PT Inocycle Technology Group Tbk (INOV)</li>

 <li>2. PT Veolia Services Indonesia</li>

 <li>PT Surya Indo Plastic (SIP)</li>

<li>PT Polindo Utama</li>
</ol>
