<center><h2><b>How Reliable is A Hyundai?</b></h2></center>
<p>In modern society, many companies are committed to environmentally friendly practices. One of them is Hyundai.
 It all began in 1947 when Chung Ju Yung founded Hyundai Construction and then the company was officially founded in 1967. Then Hyundai
 chose Indonesia as the location for its electric vehicle factory because Indonesia has large reserves of laterite nickel ore, the main material
 needed for the production of lithium-ion batteries. Hyundai was first present in Indonesia in 1995 through the Sole 
 Agent Brand Holder (ATPM). Then, in 2020, Hyundai was founded in Indonesia under the name Hyundai Motors Indonesia.</p>

 <p>Hyundai Motors Indonesia has developed into the era of future cars. In 1991, Hyundai developed its first pure electric vehicle in 1991. Namely the Sonata Electric Vehicle. Hyundai intends to develop six electric vehicles for testing by the end of 1992. Currently, Hyundai is focusing on hybrid vehicles but still producing pure electric cars.</p>
 <p>Hyundai's electric cars are environmentally friendly. This supports the creation of a healthy environment by reducing the amount of pollution in every place. Electric cars are specifically made for future generations. They want to bring health to the environment in the future.</p>

<p>Some things that make Hyundai Motor Industry sustainable:
<br>
 <ol>
<li><b>Hyundai Extensive Warranty Coverage</b></li>
 Hyundai give 5-year 60.000 mile new vehicle limited warranty which covers most components of the vehicle, including the powertrain, chassis, and electrical system. This warranty is fully tansferable to subsequent owners, providing added value and confidence for customers who may sell their vehicle before the warranty period expires. 
<li>Powertrain Warranty</li>
 Hyundai also offers an industry-leading 10 year/100.000 mile powertrain warranty. These warranty specifically offers the engine, tranmission, and related powertrain component, among a vehicle's most critical and expensive parts.
<li>Hyundai Reliability Model</li>
In addition to selling gasoline-powered cars such as the Santa Fe and Palisade models, Hyundai also sells electric-powered cars such as the Kona and Ioniq models as a form of contribution to energy change to create a healthier environment.
<li>Hybrid and Electric Powertrain</li>
Hyundai's commitment to reliable and efficient powertrains extends to hybrid and electri vehicle. Hyundai Sonata hybrid, combine gasolin engines with electric motors and lithium-ion battery packs to achieve impressive fuel economy figures.

<center><h2><b>The Contribution of Hyundai in Environment</b></h2></center>
<h3><b>Advancements in Electric and Hydrogen Vehicles</b></h3>
 <p>One of Hyundai's most significant contributions to environmental sustainability is its investment in electric and hydrogen fuel cell technologies. The company has been at the forefront of developing electric vehicles (EVs) with a range of models designed to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and minimize carbon emissions. For instance, the Hyundai Kona Electric and the Ioniq Electric represent substantial strides towards cleaner transportation. These vehicles produce zero tailpipe emissions, directly addressing the issue of air pollution and contributing to improved urban air quality.</p>
 <p>Moreover, Hyundai’s dedication to hydrogen fuel cell technology sets it apart from many competitors. The Hyundai Nexo, a hydrogen-powered SUV, exemplifies the company's commitment to exploring alternative energy sources. Hydrogen fuel cells generate electricity through a chemical reaction between hydrogen and oxygen, emitting only water vapor as a byproduct. This technology has the potential to significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially if coupled with a clean hydrogen production infrastructure. Hyundai’s investment in hydrogen technology not only promotes a more sustainable energy cycle but also supports the broader adoption of hydrogen as a viable alternative to traditional fuels.</p>

 <h3><b>Sustainable Manufacturing Process</b></h3>
 <p>Hyundai’s commitment to environmental sustainability extends beyond its vehicle lineup to its manufacturing processes. The company has made considerable efforts to reduce the environmental impact of its production facilities. Hyundai’s factories have adopted various energy-efficient technologies and practices to minimize their carbon footprint. For example, the implementation of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power helps to lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with production activities.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, Hyundai has engaged in resource conservation initiatives, including the recycling of materials and reduction of waste. By integrating closed-loop recycling systems, the company ensures that materials used in vehicle production are reused and repurposed, thereby reducing the need for raw material extraction and lowering environmental degradation. These practices reflect Hyundai’s broader commitment to circular economy principles, which aim to minimize waste and maximize resource efficiency.</p>
 <h3><b>Corporate Social Responsibility and Environmental Initiatives</b></h3>
 <p>Hyundai’s environmental efforts are also embodied in its corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs. The company actively engages in various environmental protection initiatives and community support projects. For instance, Hyundai has participated in reforestation projects and environmental clean-up campaigns, contributing to ecosystem restoration and conservation.</p>
 <p>The Hyundai Motor Group’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions is also reflected in its ambitious environmental goals. The company has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality across its global operations by 2045, a target that aligns with international climate agreements and reflects a proactive stance on combating climate change. This commitment involves not only reducing emissions from vehicle production and operation but also investing in sustainable technologies and practices that contribute to a greener future.</p>
